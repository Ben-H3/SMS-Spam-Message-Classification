# SMS-Spam-Message-Classification
This software will take as input a dataset of text messages and use a recurrent neural network to output a prediction of whether or not each message should be classified as spam. The dataset was provided by the University of California, Irvine and can be accessed here. I created this program as a culminating project after I completed the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization as well as the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn &amp; Tensorflow" by Aurélien Géron.
